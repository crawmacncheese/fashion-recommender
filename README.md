# D'Éclat

D'Éclat is an AI-Integrated virtual stylist. The goal of the project is to 
create a MERN stack application that assists users in creating outfits based on 
their needs. 

## Project Overview
As a team of two, we have decided to build this project with a MERN stack 
approach, using MongoDB as our database, ExpressJS and NodeJS for our server-side
language and ReactJS for the front-end of our application.

As people who have struggled to figure out what to wear for events, class, dates,
and the list goes on, we wanted to build an application that assists users with 
coming up with outfits. 

Obviously apps like pinterest and instagram exist, but our thing with those apps
is that they can get a little too overstimulating in terms of content being 
pushed to users.

### Goal
Our goal is to give users three outfits based on their aesthetics, budget, and 
general interests to help alleviate the time that it takes to come up with 
outfits.

## Technologies
In the Overview, we mentioned that we plan to build this application with a 
MERN stack approach, with Mongo (Mongoose) for our database, ReactJS for our 
front-end/client interface, and ExpressJS and NodeJS for our back-end/server-side 
language. 

## Wireframe
We designed a wireframe for our website application in Figma and below are some
pictures of the current wireframe. As we get deeper into the project, we'll also
include a prototype of the project as well.
