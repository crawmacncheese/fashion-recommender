# D'Éclat

D'Éclat is an AI-Integrated virtual stylist. The goal of the project is to 
create a MERN stack application that assists users in creating outfits based on 
their needs. 

## Project Overview
As a team of two, we have decided to build this project using MongoDB as our database, Flask for our server-side language and ReactJS for the front-end of our application.

As people who have struggled to figure out what to wear for events, class, dates,
and the list goes on, we wanted to build an application that assists users with 
coming up with outfits. 

Obviously apps like pinterest and instagram exist, but our thing with those apps
is that they can get a little too overstimulating in terms of content being 
pushed to users.

### Goal
Our goal is to give users three outfits based on their aesthetics, budget, and 
general interests to help alleviate the time that it takes to come up with 
outfits.

## Technologies
In the Overview, we mentioned that we plan to build this application with a 
with MongoDB (Mongoose) for our database, ReactJS for our front-end/client 
interface, and Flask for our back-end/server-side language. 

We original plan was to use TensorFlow to implement the our machine learning
models, which we still plan on doing! However, due to the nature of this being
only a semester-long project, we will use the OpenAI API to help us with 
outfit generation, while simultaneously working on and researching, and designing
our own machine learning model.

## Wireframe
We designed a wireframe for our website application in Figma and below are some
pictures of the current wireframe. As we get deeper into the project, we'll also
include a prototype of the project as well.
